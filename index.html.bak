        <p> My Time in Taiwan was filled with nothing but fun times. Teaching
          English at Xipu Elementary school in Tainan, Taiwan was such an
          amazing experience. I got to try so many new things and meet so many
          awesome people. It also opened up my eyes to a career that I never
          really considered. I learned so much about the culture, the language,
          and aswell, I was able to grow heaps and bounds both professionally
          and personally.</p>
        <span class="image main"><img title="Day1" alt="First Time Meeting Class"

            src="images/P5130107%20%281%29.JPG"></span>Not only did I get to try
        alot of things I wouldnt have even thought I would ever try, but I was
        also able to meet other individuals from all over the world who were
        also doing an exchange project in Taiwan. During the weekends, we would
        travel all around Taiwan exploring and sightseeing. The highlight of my
        trip was when we took a ferry to a nearby Taiwanese island named 小琉球
        (XiaoLiuQui). During this 3 day trip, we went scuba diving, hiking
        through mountainous areas, and really bonded as friends. Even though we
        had only known each other for such a short period of time, it felt like
        we had known each other for many years.<span class="image main"><img title="Host Fam"

            alt="Host family" src="../../../Downloads/Host-Fam.jpg"><br>
          During my time in Taiwan, I also stayed with a host family. From the
          first day I arrived, everyone was so kind and caring and it felt like
          they were actually my family. They even bought me a birthday cake to
          celebrate me turning 19 while I was there. The first couple of weeks
          of my exchange, they took me out on weekends to go sightseeing and to
          Tainan city's famous night markets where one could purchase many
          different types of tradition Taiwanese foods such as Taiwanese chicken
          steaks, stinky tofu, and their delicious beef noodle bowls. In
          addition, there was also many places you could shop at, meaning there
          was something for everyone.<span class="image main"><img title="Night Market"

          class="image main">If you're thinking about going on an exchange, I
          would honestly say to do it because you never know what kind of
          friendships you will make and what kind of things you will
          learn.&nbsp; </span> </article>

        <p><strong>Katherine's Story</strong></p>
        <p>It wasn’t that hard for me to adjust to Taiwan. However, I did need
          some time to adapt to the new environment. It ranged from big things
          such as seeing all the signs in Chinese, needing to speak Mandarin,
          and trying to find my way around the city to small things such as
          drinking a lot more tea whenever I went out with friends</p>
        <p> I found it useful to ground myself to something. For instance, The
          teachers at Jee An Elementary School are welcoming and friendly. They
          always made sure that I am well taken care of and helped me a lot
          along the way. Therefore, it was easy to make friends and feel
          comfortable around them. As well, I love children. I found them very
          cute, especially the preschoolers. Whenever they see me, they would
          yell out my name to greet me, despite the fact that I am half way
          across the school. They are extremely sweet so they brighten my day.<span

            class="image main"><img title="Preschoolers" alt="Students" src="images/Katheriene%281%29.jpg"></span>
          Also, I maintained contact with my family and friends in Vancouver,
          basically the people who I can talk just about everything with. It
          helped that the local LC, AIESEC CKLC (National Cheng Kung University)
          took great care in helping me to adjust to Taiwan. They had arranged a
          welcoming party for me and a new Exchange Participant from Brazil,
          Fabi. They also arranged different events throughout the three months
          period so that we were able to keep in touch, such as going to see a
          movie. For anyone thinking of going on exchange, I my advice would
          just to be open-minded. There are always things that didn’t turn out
          the way I wanted. However, I wasn’t here to get pampered, I was there
          to experience something different. Therefore, I didn’t let the
          disappointments get in my way too much.</p>
        <span class="image main"><img title="Preschoolers" alt="Students" src="images/cklc-welcome-party%28Katherine%29.jpg"></span>
        <p> On exchange, I was able do things I have never done before. For
          instance, because Madou, the place where I was staying at, is in a
          small town, I was able to go to the field and pick oranges. As well, I
          was able to create a picture using real flowers and leaves—the Flower
          Art. </p>
        <span class="image main"><img title="Preschoolers" alt="Students" src="images/picking-oranges%28Katheriene%29.jpg"></span>
        <p>During my free time, I did a bit of travelling with friends and
          experienced the Taiwanese culture. The highlight of my trip is
          visiting Tainan. It is one of the oldest cities in Taiwan. Little is
          known before the Dutch came to Taiwan during the 1600. However, the
          Dutch occupied it for only about twenty years before the Chinese came
          and banished them off. After, during the end of the 1800, the Japanese
          took over Taiwan and had stayed for almost fifty years. As a result,
          Taiwan’s architectures are influenced those by the Dutch, Chinese, and
          the Japanese. Particularly in Tainan, there were a lot of historical
          monuments around the city. I was able to go around Tainan and got to
          learn about the history and geographic of the place and henceforth,
          Taiwan. </p>
        <span class="image main"><img title="Tainan Temple" alt="Temple" src="../../../Downloads/Tainan-Temple.jpg"></span>
        <p>For those who are still deciding, I really recommend going on a
          exchange. You get to meet different people, do things you never
          thought you will ever do, and pick up a new language along the way. </p>
